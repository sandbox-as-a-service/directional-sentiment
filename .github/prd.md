### **1. Problem Statement**

There’s no neutral, persistent place to see what Americans lean toward on key issues.

- X polls → biased, ephemeral, shaped by who you follow and algorithm reach.
- Reddit → dominated by ideological brigades and downvote culture.
- Pollsters → accurate but slow, expensive, and limited in scope.

**Need:** A curated, always-on gauge of public sentiment across topics (politics, culture, products, sports, etc.).

---

### **2. Goal / Success Metrics (First 30 Days)**

- **>1,000 votes cast** across seeded polls.
- **At least 20% return traffic** (users checking back on ongoing polls).
- **Organic sharing** of results (links, screenshots).
- Evidence of **argument ammo behavior** (people using polls in debates, discussions).

---

### **3. Users & Use Cases**

- **Debaters / armchair analysts** → want receipts to prove their side isn’t fringe.
- **Curious normies** → want quick answers to everyday curiosity (“what’s the real #1 Ben & Jerry’s flavor?”).
- **Journalists / content creators** → want fast, directional sentiment for stories and hot takes.

---

### **4. Core Value Proposition**

**Opinion Registry** = _Directional public sentiment._

Not a scientific poll, not a throwaway poll, not a social feed — a **curated public gauge** showing where opinion leans on current topics that never ends, it evolves as opinions change.

---

### **5. MVP Scope**

**Must-Haves (Core Loop):**

- Feed of curated polls (Twitter-like cards).
- Instant voting (1 click). (no submit button). Show immediate % update with optimistic UI
- Results visible **“Warming up” state** until quorum (e.g., 30 unique voters). (chart + %).
- Persistent archive (old polls don’t vanish, can be revisited).
- Shareable results (links, OG cards, easy screenshots).

**Nice-to-Haves:**

- Topic filters (Politics, Culture, Products, Sports, etc.).
- Poll detail view with historical trend (if enough votes).
- Mobile-first responsive layout.

**Out of Scope (for MVP):**

- User poll creation. Site moderators handle poll creation in a bias-free, junk-free way.
- Commenting / discussion threads.
- Account systems, gamification, profiles.
- Advanced analytics (demographics, geo-breakdowns).

---

### **6. Differentiation**

- Unlike X polls → not ephemeral, not algorithm-biased.
- Unlike Reddit → not brigaded into oblivion, curated for balance.
- Unlike Gallup/Pew → not pretending to be statistically perfect, just directional.

---

### **7. Risks / Open Questions**

- **Curation bottleneck** → how many polls do you need to keep the feed fresh?
- **Perception** → will users see it as useful “gauge” vs “toy site”?
- **Manipulation** → how to handle brigading or vote spamming? (tech + curation problem).
