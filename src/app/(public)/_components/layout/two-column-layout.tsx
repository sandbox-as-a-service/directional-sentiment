/**
 * Design Decision Analysis: Component Patterns for Layout Components
 *
 * Option A: Controlled by the layout (props + CSS on the root)
 *
 * What it is
 *
 * The root layout owns cross-child behavior like stacked ordering or "expand when no aside."
 * Consumers flip behavior with small, well-named props (e.g., stackAsideFirst, expandMainWhenNoAside).
 * Implementation uses container-scoped selectors and Tailwind utilities (:has, order-first xl:order-none, etc.).
 *
 * Pros
 *
 * Consistency. Everyone gets the same behavior from the same API. Lower variance across the codebase.
 * First paint correctness. Root CSS decides without waiting on render order or context.
 * Low cognitive load. Callsite stays declarative: stackAsideFirst says exactly what will happen.
 * A11y safer by default. You can centralize how visual order changes vs source order and document it once.
 * Refactor-friendly. If the grid template or breakpoints change, you fix it in one place.
 *
 * Cons
 *
 * API surface. Adds a few props to the root. You must keep them minimal and well named.
 * Hidden magic. Container selectors can feel "spooky" if the team is not used to :has or Tailwind arbitrary variants.
 * Edge overrides. Consumers still need escape hatches via className for the 1% cases.
 *
 * When to prefer
 *
 * Internal design system with locked spacing and breakpoints.
 * Multiple teams consuming the layout.
 * You want predictable behavior and fewer per-screen decisions.
 *
 * Option B: Let the consumer handle it (manual DOM order or ad-hoc classes)
 *
 * What it is
 *
 * Consumers reorder children in JSX or add their own utility classes to achieve stack-first and other behaviors.
 *
 * // Reorder DOM manually when stacked is desired
 * <TwoColumnLayout>
 *   <TwoColumnLayout.Aside>aside</TwoColumnLayout.Aside>
 *   <TwoColumnLayout.Main>main</TwoColumnLayout.Main>
 * </TwoColumnLayout>
 *
 * // Or sprinkle classes ad-hoc
 * <TwoColumnLayout>
 *   <TwoColumnLayout.Main className="xl:col-span-2">main</TwoColumnLayout.Main>
 * </TwoColumnLayout>
 *
 * Pros
 *
 * Maximum flexibility. No waiting on the layout API for new tweaks.
 * Fewer root props. Keeps the component surface tiny.
 * Explicitness at callsite. You see the literal JSX order or classes right there.
 *
 * Cons
 *
 * Inconsistency creep. Every screen can do it slightly differently. Harder to audit or change globally.
 * A11y risk. Reordering DOM changes reading and tab order, which might not match visual order. Using CSS order-* flips visual order but not DOM order, which can also confuse screen readers if used thoughtlessly.
 * Higher error rate. Easy to forget self-start for sticky, or to miss resetting order at the breakpoint, or to mismatch spans when the aside is removed.
 * Maintenance tax. When design changes, you touch many callsites.
 * Onboarding cost. New devs must relearn the patterns for each page.
 *
 * When to prefer
 *
 * One-off prototypes or very custom screens where global rules do not fit.
 *
 * Very small teams where one person controls most screens.

/**
 * Component Pattern Evaluation for Layout Components
 *
 * 1) Compound components (what you're using)
 *
 * DX / types: Great. Consumers get TwoColumnLayout.Main / .Aside with normal JSX, full TS inference.
 * Nesting: Works fine with wrappers (you used data-slot + container selectors; not brittle).
 * SSR / RSC: Safe. No render-time child walking or effects required.
 * Reordering / rules: Root knobs (stackAsideFirst, expandMainWhenNoAside) are predictable; you already pinned desktop with xl:col-start-* and solved the auto-placement row gap with grid-flow-row-dense.
 * Verdict: ‚úÖ Keep. It's the simplest, most maintainable match for "main/aside" layouts.
 *
 * 2) "Multiple slot props" (header, footer, etc.)
 *
 * DX / types: Very discoverable and type-safe.
 * Nesting: Breaks if you want to wrap slot content in providers; everything must be passed as props.
 * SSR / RSC: Safe, but less composable.
 * Verdict: Fine for small, leaf components. For layouts, it fights natural composition. ‚ùå Not better here.
 *
 * 3) Slots by type (scan children, match child.type === Header)
 * 
 * DX / types: Still feels natural to write.
 * Nesting: Works through wrappers.
 * SSR / RSC: Can be OK, but it's brittle: equality checks on child.type can break with HMR, memo, forwardRef, or bundler boundaries; you end up adding guards. Also adds runtime work on every render.
 * Verdict: Overkill for 2 children; adds fragility you don't need. ‚ùå
 *
 * 4) Generic <Slot name="...">
 * 
 * DX / types: Loses type safety unless you build extra machinery to constrain names.
 * Nesting: Works.
 * SSR / RSC: Fine.
 * Verdict: You give up the whole point of compound components (typed, discoverable API). ‚ùå
 *
 * 5) Context-registered slots (Primer style)
 *
 * DX / types: Very flexible; can keep type safety with a factory.
 * Nesting: Best-in-class (works anywhere in the subtree).
 * SSR / RSC: Weak point. Registration usually happens in effects; you don't know slots at server render, so first paint/hydration can be off or require a client pass.
 * Verdict: Use only if you truly need arbitrary, deep, multi-slot collection. Massive overkill for main/aside. ‚ùå
 *
 * 6) "Fake DOM" / portal prepass (React Aria Components)
 *
 * DX / types: Powerful for collections, menus, trees.
 * Nesting: Excellent.
 * SSR / RSC: Designed to handle it, but at the cost of complexity and double render paths.
 * Verdict: Way beyond the scope of a 2-region layout. üö´
 *
 * Bottom line for your layout

 * Keep the compound pattern with root knobs (container concerns) and child-local props (e.g., stickyOffsetClassName).
 * Keep the CSS-driven logic (:has for "no aside" upgrade if you want it, grid-flow-row-dense, xl:col-start-* to pin columns). That gave you first-paint correctness without context races.
 * Avoid child-type scanning and context-slots; they solve problems you don't have and introduce new ones.
